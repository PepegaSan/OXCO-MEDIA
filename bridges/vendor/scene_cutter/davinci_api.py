"""Reference implementation for reliably connecting to DaVinci Resolve Studio.

Drop this file into a new project and call :func:`connect_resolve` — it
enforces every rule that tends to cause silent Resolve-API failures on
Windows. Ships with project-side helpers (:func:`list_render_presets`,
:func:`apply_project_timeline_settings`, :func:`render_with_preset`) so a
downstream pipeline can stay small.

Pattern summary (why each piece exists)
=======================================

1. **Purge stale env vars before import**
   Resolve sets ``RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API`` / ``RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB`` globally.
   If a previous run of a different Resolve edition (Free vs Studio vs Beta)
   left them pointing at a dead DLL, the import fails with a useless
   ``ImportError("Could not locate module dependencies")``. Always pop the
   old values first, then set fresh ones from a multi-edition candidate
   list.

2. **Prefer the edition of the running ``Resolve.exe``**
   With multiple Resolve editions installed side by side the candidate
   list alone can bind the wrong ``fusionscript.dll``. Query the running
   process's full path via PowerShell, derive the matching DLL + modules
   dir from it, fall back to the static list only if no Resolve is up.

3. **Search every install layout, not just Free**
   Blackmagic's stock ``DaVinciResolveScript.py`` hardcodes the Free path.
   Studio / Studio 21 Beta / 21 Beta live elsewhere. ``_first_existing``
   picks whichever one actually exists on disk.

4. **``time.sleep(2)`` before importing ``DaVinciResolveScript``**
   Right after Resolve starts, fusionscript.dll can still be file-locked;
   the import silently fails without the short delay.

5. **Forward slashes for every path handed to the API**
   Backslashes silently break ``ImportMedia`` / render target paths on
   Windows. Convert once at the boundary (:func:`to_forward`).

6. **Initialise COM on every worker thread**
   Resolve's scripting C-module uses COM. Threads that haven't called
   ``CoInitializeEx`` get a silent ``None`` from ``scriptapp('Resolve')``
   even though the main thread works fine — a classic "works in script,
   broken in GUI" trap. Wrap worker-thread interaction in the
   :func:`scripting_thread` context manager.

7. **Connect strategy — try, launch only if needed, poll**
   - Call ``scriptapp("Resolve")`` immediately. On a running Resolve this
     returns in < 1s, so the no-op case stays fast.
   - If it returns ``None`` **and** ``Resolve.exe`` is not in the task list,
     launch Resolve.exe. NEVER Popen a second time on an already-running
     Resolve — it wobbles the scripting socket and breaks the session.
   - Poll ``scriptapp`` every 2s for up to 90s. Each call blocks ~5s during
     boot, so a healthy cold start completes in 2-3 attempts (~10-15s).
   - Emit an actionable "External scripting = Local" hint after the second
     failed poll (~4s) rather than burying it in a 90s timeout.

8. **Scratch-project fallback**
   Cold-launched Resolve lands on the Project Manager screen where
   ``GetCurrentProject()`` returns ``None`` forever. Automation must create
   a scratch project so it can proceed unattended.

Common failure modes the connect loop surfaces (in order of frequency):
    1. ``Preferences → System → General → External scripting using`` is not
       set to ``Local``. Saving alone isn't enough; Resolve must restart.
    2. Worker thread never called CoInitializeEx (see :func:`scripting_thread`).
    3. Privilege mismatch — Resolve started as admin while Python runs as
       user, or vice versa. Windows isolates the scripting socket per
       privilege level; both must run at the same elevation.
    4. Modal dialog open inside Resolve (unsaved-changes, render progress,
       auto-save prompt). These block the scripting server from answering.
    5. DaVinci Resolve **Free** — external scripting is Studio-only. Note:
       on Resolve 21 the ``ProductName`` version resource reports the same
       string ("DaVinci Resolve") for both editions, so we deliberately do
       NOT hard-gate on that. We log it for info and let ``scriptapp`` fail.
    6. No project open — Project Manager screen. Handled automatically by
       the scratch-project fallback when you allow it.

Usage
-----

Single-threaded (CLI script)::

    from davinci_api import connect_resolve, to_forward

    resolve, project, media_pool, root_folder = connect_resolve(
        status_callback=print,   # wire to your UI status bar
        auto_launch=True,
    )
    media_pool.ImportMedia([to_forward(r"C:\\clips\\take01.mp4")])

GUI worker thread (CustomTkinter / PySide / Qt threads)::

    from davinci_api import connect_resolve, scripting_thread

    def worker():
        with scripting_thread():            # COM init / uninit for this thread
            resolve, project, *_ = connect_resolve()
            print(project.GetName())

    threading.Thread(target=worker, daemon=True).start()

Full pipeline example (render preset picker + matching timeline)::

    from davinci_api import (
        connect_resolve, scripting_thread, to_forward,
        cleanup_timelines, list_render_presets,
        apply_project_timeline_settings, render_with_preset,
    )

    with scripting_thread():
        resolve, project, media_pool, root = connect_resolve()

        clips = media_pool.ImportMedia([to_forward(video_path)])
        clip = clips[0]

        # Purge our OWN leftover timelines so Resolve no longer locks
        # the project frame rate. Without this step, SetSetting below
        # silently no-ops and the new timeline inherits the old rate.
        cleanup_timelines(project, media_pool, name_prefix="AutoRun_")

        fps = clip.GetClipProperty("FPS") or "25"
        res = clip.GetClipProperty("Resolution") or "1920x1080"
        apply_project_timeline_settings(project, fps, res)  # pass raw string

        timeline = media_pool.CreateEmptyTimeline(f"AutoRun_{int(time.time())}")
        project.SetCurrentTimeline(timeline)
        media_pool.AppendToTimeline([{"mediaPoolItem": clip}])

        # Render preset dropdown UX: if Resolve is already up, use the
        # live list; otherwise the user can still type the preset name
        # by hand into their combobox (the render helper below validates
        # via its fallback chain).
        presets = list_render_presets(project)
        render_with_preset(
            project,
            output_dir=r"C:\\output",
            output_name="take01_autoedit",
            preset_name=presets[0] if presets else None,
            status_callback=print,
        )

    Parameters
    ----------
    status_callback:
        Receives human-readable progress strings ("Launching…", "Waiting for
        scripting server… 72s left"). Wire this to your UI status bar.
    auto_launch:
        When ``True`` and Resolve is not running, ``Resolve.exe`` is started
        automatically. When ``False`` a missing Resolve raises immediately.
    create_scratch_project_name:
        When non-empty and no project is open after connecting, a new project
        with this base name (plus a timestamp) is created. Set to ``None`` to
        fail hard instead — useful for tools that must never touch the
        Project Manager.

    Must be called from a thread where COM is initialised (use the
    :func:`scripting_thread` context manager on GUI worker threads).

    Raises
    ------
    ResolveError
        When scripting files can't be located, when Resolve can't be launched
